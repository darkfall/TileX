TileX is a simple tile map editor for Unity3D 4.3 based on Sprites

Its a side project developed by me during the GGJ 2014 in a very short amount of time, so things may not working correctly and features are missing for now.

Hotkeys:

* Mouse right click to rotate a tile


Todos:

* Better layers and ObjectLayer / ImageLayer support
* Perspective tile support
* Exporting/Importing functionalities
* Better editor GUI layout 
* ...
